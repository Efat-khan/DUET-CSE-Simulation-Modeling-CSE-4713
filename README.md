## 📂 Project Details  

### 1. 🎲 Monte Carlo Method  
Simulate random processes using the **Monte Carlo method**, a powerful statistical tool for estimating results in systems with inherent randomness.  

### 2. 📄 Document Processing  
A simulation for processing a sequence of documents, managing tasks like prioritization, and queue-based handling.  

### 3. ✈️ Bomber Fighter Simulation  
Simulate the dynamic interaction between **bombers** and **fighters**, visualizing their behavior and strategies.  

### 4. ⚗️ Chemical Reaction Simulation  
Model simple chemical reactions to observe the interaction between reactants and the formation of products over time.  

### 5. 🕒 Single Service Queue Simulation  
Simulate a **single service queue** to study customer wait times, server utilization, and system performance.  

### 6. 🏀 Falling Bouncing Ball  
Model the motion of a ball as it falls and bounces under the influence of gravity and elasticity.  

### 7. 🎲 Random Number - Mid Square Method  
Generate random numbers using the **Mid Square Method**, a classical technique in simulation and cryptography.  

### 8. 🔀 Merge Sort  
Implement and simulate the **Merge Sort** algorithm for efficiently sorting a list of elements.  

### 9. 🕸️ Cobweb Model Simulation  
Simulate a **cobweb model**, which is used to analyze the dynamics of supply, demand, and prices in a market.  

### 10. ⚖️ Equilibrium Point Calculation  
Calculate the **equilibrium point** of a simple market function using mathematical simulation and analysis.
